This section contains tutorials showing how to use the diferent VCA filters.
Berfore starting with this section, it would be very interesting that you have
a look to the :doc:`API <APIs>` and the :doc:`architecture <architecture>`.

As it was explained on the :doc:`API <APIs>` section, these filters can be used
with different technologies.Here, we are going to explain this guide using a
web application which interacts with and application server based on JavaEE
technogoly. This application server will be in charge of holding the logic
orchestration, the communication among the clients and controlling the Server
capabilites.

Here we are going to see the following examples:
