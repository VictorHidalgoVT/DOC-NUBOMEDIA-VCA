This section contains tutorials showing how to use the diferent VCA filters. Berfore starting 
with this section, it would be very interesting that you have a look to the
:doc:`API <APIs>` and the :doc:`architecture <architecture>`.

As it was explained on the :doc:`API <APIs>` section, these filters can be used with
different technologies.Here, we are going to explain this guide using a web application which
interacts with and application server based on JavaEE technogoly. This application server will be
in charge of holding the logic orchestration, the communication among the clients and controlling
the Server capabilites.

Here we are going to see the following examples:
