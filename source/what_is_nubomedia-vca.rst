What's NUBOMEDIA-VCA?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

**NUBOMEDIA-VCA** is a part of the `NUBOMEDIA <http://www.nubomedia.eu>`__ ,
which is the first cloud platform specifically designed for hosting interactive
multimedia services. NUBOMEDIA exposes to developers PaaS APIs for creating
media pipelines. A media pipeline is a  chain of elements providing media
capabilities such as encryption, transcoding, augmented reality or video
content analysis. These chains allow building arbitrarily complex media
processing for applications. As a unique feature, from the point of view of the
pipelines, the NUBOMEDIA cloud infrastructure behaves as a single virtual
super-computer encompassing all the available resources of the physical
network. This part of the project is in charge of the
**Video Content Analysis (VCA)**, through which the developers can apply
different computer vision filters to their media pipelines.

Through this documentation you can learn how to
:doc:`install <installation_guide>` and :doc:`develop using the API <APIs>` of
the following filters: **face detector**, **mouth detector**,
**nose detector**, **eye detector**, **ear detector**, and **tracker filter**.
Futhermore, you can find information about :doc:`tutorials <tutorials>` in
order to test the different filters, and also you can read more about the VCA
:doc:`architecture <architecture>` within NUBOMEDIA.
