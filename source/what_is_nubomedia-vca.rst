**Nubomedia-vca** is a part of the
`Nubomedia project <http://www.nubomedia.eu>`__ .

NUBOMEDIA is the first cloud platform specifically designed for hosting
interactive multimedia services. NUBOMEDIA exposes to developers PaaS APIs for
creating media pipelines. A media pipeline is a  chain of elements providing
media capabilities such as encryption, transcoding, augmented reality or video
content analysis. These chains allow building arbitrarily complex media
processing for applications. As a unique feature, from the point of view of the
pipelines, the NUBOMEDIA cloud infrastructure behaves as a single virtual
super-computer encompassing all the available resources of the physical network.

In particular, this part of the project is in charge of the computer vision
technology, through which the developers can apply different computer vision
filters to their pipelines.


Through this documentation you can learn how to install
:doc:`install <installation_guide>`, develop using the API of the following
filters of the NUBOMEDIA project:

- Face Detector
- Mouth Detector
- Nose Detector
- Eye Detector
- Ear Detector
- Tracker

Futhermore, you can find information about demos in order to test the different
filters.
