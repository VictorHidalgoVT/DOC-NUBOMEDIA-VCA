**NUBOMEDIA-VCA** is a part of the `NUBOMEDIA <http://www.nubomedia.eu>`__ ,
which is the first cloud platform specifically designed for hosting interactive
multimedia services. NUBOMEDIA exposes to developers PaaS APIs for creating
media pipelines. A media pipeline is a  chain of elements providing media
capabilities such as encryption, transcoding, augmented reality or video
content analysis. These chains allow building arbitrarily complex media
processing for applications. As a unique feature, from the point of view of the
pipelines, the NUBOMEDIA cloud infrastructure behaves as a single virtual
super-computer encompassing all the available resources of the physical network.

This part of the project is in charge of the **Video Content Analysis (VCA)**,
through which the developers can apply different computer vision filters to
their media pipelines.

Through this documentation you can learn how to install
:doc:`install <installation_guide>`, develop using the API of the following
filters of the NUBOMEDIA project:

- Face detector filter
- Mouth detector filter
- Nose detector filter
- Eye detector filter
- Ear detector filter
- Tracker filter

Futhermore, you can find information about demos in order to test the different
filters.
